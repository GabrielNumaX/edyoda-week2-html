        Washington, D.C., formally the District of Columbia and commonly referred to as
        Washington or D.C., is the capital of the United States. <br>
        Founded after the American Revolution as the seat of government of the newly
        independent country, Washington was named after George Washington, the first president
        of the United States and a Founding Father. <br>
        As the seat of the United States federal government and several international
        organizations, Washington is an important world political capital. <br>
        The city, located on the Potomac River bordering Maryland and Virginia, is one of the
        most visited cities in the world, with more than 20 million tourists annually.<br>

        The signing of the Residence Act on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of a capital
        district located along the Potomac River on the country's East Coast. <br>
        The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction
        of the U.S. Congress, and the District is therefore not a part of any state. <br>
        The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district,
        which included the pre-existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria. <br>
        The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital.
        In 1846, Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia; in 1871, it created a
        single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District.<br>

        Washington had an estimated population of 702,455 as of July 2018, making it the 20th
        most populous city in the United States. Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and
        Virginia suburbs raise the city's daytime population to more than one million during
        the workweek. Washington's metropolitan area, the country's sixth largest, had a
        2017 estimated population of 6.2 million residents.
