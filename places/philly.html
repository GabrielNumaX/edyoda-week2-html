        Philadelphia, known colloquially as Philly, is the largest city in the U.S. state and
        Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the sixth-most populous U.S. city, with a 2018
        census-estimated population of 1,584,138. <br>
        Since 1854, the city has been coterminous with Philadelphia County, the most populous
        county in Pennsylvania and the urban core of the eighth-largest U.S. metropolitan
        statistical area, with over 6 million residents as of 2017. <br>
        Philadelphia is also the economic and cultural anchor of the greater Delaware Valley,
        located along the lower Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers, within the Northeast
        megalopolis. <br>

        William Penn, an English Quaker, founded the city in 1682 to serve as capital of the
        Pennsylvania Colony. Philadelphia played an instrumental role in the American
        Revolution as a meeting place for the Founding Fathers of the United States, who
        signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776 at the Second Continental Congress,
        and the Constitution at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787. <br>
