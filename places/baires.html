        Buenos Aires is the capital and largest city of Argentina. The city is located on the
        western shore of the estuary of the Río de la Plata, on the American continent's
        southeastern coast. "Buenos Aires" can be translated as "fair winds" or "good airs",
        but the former was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use
        of the original name "Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre".<br>
        The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province
        districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with
        a population of around 15.6 million. <br>

        The city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province's
        capital; rather, it is an autonomous district. In 1880, after decades of political
        infighting, Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province.
        The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores; both are now
        neighborhoods of the city. <br>
        The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy, hence its formal name:
        Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires; "CABA").
        Its citizens first elected a chief of government (i.e. mayor) in 1996; previously,
        the mayor was directly appointed by the President of the Republic.

        Buenos Aires is a top tourist destination, and is known for its preserved Eclectic
        European architecture and rich cultural life. Buenos Aires held the 1st Pan American
        Games in 1951 as well as hosting two venues in the 1978 FIFA World Cup. Buenos Aires
        hosted the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics and the 2018 G20 summit. <br>

        Buenos Aires is a multicultural city, being home to multiple ethnic and religious
        groups. Several languages are spoken in the city in addition to Spanish, contributing
        to its culture and the dialect spoken in the city and in some other parts of the
        country. This is because in the last 151 years the city, and the country in general,
        has been a major recipient of millions of immigrants from all over the world, making
        it a melting pot where several ethnic groups live together and being considered one
        of the most diverse cities of the Americas.
