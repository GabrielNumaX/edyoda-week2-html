        Florianópolis is the capital and second largest city of the state of Santa Catarina,
        in the South region of Brazil. The city encompasses Santa Catarina Island and
        surrounding small islands, as well as part of the mainland.
        It has a population of 477,798, according to the 2016 IBGE population estimate,
        the second most populous city in the state (after Joinville), and the 47th in Brazil.
        The metropolitan area has an estimated population of 1,111,702, the 21st largest in the
        country. <br>
        The city is known for having the country's third highest Human Development Index score
        among all Brazilian cities (0.847). The city is considered safe by Brazilian standards.
        In 2014, Florianópolis had the second-lowest incidence of murders of Brazilian capitals. <br>

        The economy of Florianópolis is heavily based on information technology, tourism and
        services. The city has 60 beaches and is a center of surfing activity.
        Lagoa da Conceição is the most famous area for tourism, recreation, nature and radical sports.
        The New York Times reported that "Florianopolis is the Party Destination of the Year in
        2009." Newsweek placed Florianópolis in the "Ten most dynamic cities of the world" list
        in 2006. Veja, a Brazilian publication, named the city as "the best place to live in
        Brazil." As a result of this exposure, Florianópolis is growing as a second home
        destination for many Paulistas, Argentines, North Americans, and Europeans.<br>

        Most of the population lives on the mainland and on the island's central and northern
        parts. The southern half is less inhabited. Many small commercial fishermen populate the island.
        The fishing boats, the lacemakers, the folklore, the cuisine and the colonial
        architecture contribute to the growing tourism and attracts resources that compensate
        for the lack of any large industry. Villages immersed in tradition and history, such as
        Santo Antônio de Lisboa and Ribeirão da Ilha still resist the advances of modernity.
